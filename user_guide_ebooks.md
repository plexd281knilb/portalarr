### 📱 EPUB-Only Amazon Delivery Standard
- Amazon officially discontinued `.mobi` and `.azw` file delivery for Send-to-Kindle.

### 📋 Outbound Delivery History & Error Tracker
- All outbound deliveries are logged in the **Kindle Delivery History** panel with timestamps, recipient emails, file formats, and file sizes.
- **Status Indicators:**
  - 🟢 **`DELIVERED`**: The file was accepted by the SMTP mail relay and dispatched to Amazon.
  - 🔴 **`DELIVERY FAILED`**: Displays the exact failure cause (e.g. unwhitelisted sender, file size over 50MB, or network timeout) along with actionable troubleshooting tips.
- **1-Click Retry (`RotateCcw`):** Click **`Retry Delivery`** on any failed log entry to re-attempt sending once the issue has been resolved.

## 🔍 6. Discovering & Requesting Books (The Unified Hub)

Requesting books and audiobooks is fully integrated into the unified **Discover (`/discover`)** and **Requests (`/requests`)** experience:

### 🌟 Discover Hub (`/discover`)
- **Popular & Trending Carousels:** Browse trending books and audiobooks alongside movies and TV shows, with high-definition artwork, author credits, and genre tags.
- **"Missing from Your Series" Carousel:** Automatically scans your existing book library and highlights the next unacquired installments in series you already follow!
- **Global Search with Autocomplete:** Type any book title, author, or series name into the search bar. Real-time autocomplete queries Audible, iTunes, OpenLibrary, and Google Books simultaneously with format badges (**`📖 Ebook`** vs **`🎧 Audiobook`**).

### 📖 Interactive Book Detail Modal
Click any book in Discover or search results to open the comprehensive detail view:
- **Synopsis & Metadata:** Read the full publisher synopsis, view publication year, page count, and series volume numbers.
- **Author & Series Links:** Click the author's name to view their complete bibliography, or click the series title to view all installments in chronological reading order.
- **Similar Books Carousel:** Browse algorithmically recommended similar books directly inside the modal with 1-click exploration.
- **1-Click Request Buttons:** Prominent **`📖 Request Ebook`** and **`🎧 Request Audiobook`** buttons dispatch the request instantly.
- **Auto-Approval:** All book requests are automatically approved and dispatched to background download indexers immediately.

### 👤 Author & Series Catalogs
- **Author Detail Modal (`AuthorDetailModal`):** Browse the author's complete catalog of published books, audiobooks, and series.
- **Series Detail Modal (`SeriesDetailModal`):** See every volume in the series numbered sequentially (`Vol 1`, `Vol 2`, `Vol 3`...) with instant 1-click grab buttons for missing installments.

### 🏷️ Tier 1 Request-First Metadata Binding
- When you submit a request, its canonical metadata (`title`, `author`, `series`, `volumeNumber`, `coverUrl`) is locked in the SQLite database relations (`Author` and `BookSeries`).
- When the file downloads, DomsHomeLab binds the downloaded media directly to these relations, ensuring clean on-disk organization (`Author / Series / Title`) without messy guessing or folder misidentification.

### 🔄 Non-EPUB to EPUB Standardized Conversion
- When downloads complete, non-EPUB files (MOBI, AZW3, PDF) are automatically converted into standardized, clean EPUB format via background conversion engines (`ebook-convert`).
- Redundant legacy files (`.mobi`, `.azw3`) are safely cleaned up from disk once the EPUB version is verified, keeping your storage optimized and 100% Kindle-compatible.

## ❓ 11. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Where do I go to request new books or audiobooks?**  
A: Head to the **Discover** tab (`/discover`). You can browse popular books and audiobooks or search by title, author, or series name. Click on any title to open the detail view and click **`Request Ebook`** or **`Request Audiobook`**. All requests are auto-approved instantly!

**Q: Will requested ebooks automatically send to my Kindle?**  
A: Yes! Once you have saved your Kindle email address in the **Kindle Settings** tab in `/library`, any ebook you request will be automatically dispatched to your Kindle as soon as the download finishes.

**Q: Why does Send-to-Kindle only support EPUB files?**  
A: Amazon officially deprecated MOBI and AZW file delivery via Send-to-Kindle. DomsHomeLab automatically standardizes non-EPUB files (MOBI, AZW3, PDF) into clean, valid EPUBs so they deliver wirelessly and display properly on your Kindle e-reader.

**Q: Can I read EPUB files offline?**  
A: Yes. Once an EPUB is opened in DomsHomeLab's reader, it is cached in your browser's persistent CacheStorage (`portalarr-books-v1`). You can resume reading even if you temporarily lose your internet or server connection.

**Q: Why did my Kindle email delivery fail?**  
A: Go to the **Kindle Settings** tab in `/library` and inspect the **Kindle Delivery History** log. Common reasons:
1. Your server's sending email is not on your Amazon Approved Personal Document E-mail List.
2. The file size exceeds Amazon's 50MB limit.
3. The recipient email was not an `@kindle.com` address.
After correcting the issue, click **`Retry Delivery`** to resend immediately.

**Q: How do I scan for newly added files in my shared folders?**  
A: Click **`Scan Share Folder`** (for Ebooks) or **`Scan Audio Folder`** (for Audiobooks) at the top of any library shelf in `/library` to trigger an instant background scan.
