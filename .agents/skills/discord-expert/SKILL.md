# Discord Bot & Community Integration Expert Guide

Portalarr integrates with Discord via a lightweight, native REST API bot engine (`discordFetch`) that provisions an automated community server, synchronizes member roles with web accounts, broadcasts infrastructure health and request telemetry, and publishes interactive guides.

---

## 🚨 Strict Public Policies & Core Rules

### 1. Absolute Zero-Pricing & Zero-Tier Concealment Policy
- **Never reveal Tier 1 vs Tier 2:** Tier 2 members are higher-paying accounts who receive managed support because they need more hands-on assistance. Publicly, both tiers are identical and unified under the single **`⭐ Member`** role in Discord.
- **No commercial or pricing terms in Discord:**
  - Prohibited strings: `$15`, `$17.50`, `$180`, `$240`, `Cash App`, `Venmo`, `Zelle`, `Billing Ledger`, `Tier 1`, `Tier 2`, `Subscription Fee`, `Invoice`.
  - Embeds and channel topics must strictly discuss platform features, technical setup, automated requests, library guides, and community discussions.

### 2. Strict Trial Isolation & Gating Protocol
- **Default Permissions:**
  - `@everyone` and `⏱️ Trial Pass` are denied `VIEW_CHANNEL` across all categories and channels **except `#welcome-and-rules`**.
  - Trial members entering the Discord server only see `#welcome-and-rules`.
  - They are instructed to log in to the Portalarr Web Portal (`home.domshomelab.com`) and link their Discord handle in **Account Settings $\rightarrow$ Profile**.
- **Role Elevation:**
  - Once linked, the user's role is automatically evaluated in Portalarr and updated to **`⭐ Member`** via the Discord REST API.
  - Elevating to `⭐ Member` instantly unlocks Category 2 (Guides), Category 3 (Community Chat), Category 4 (Requests & Media), and Category 5 (Help & Tickets).

### 3. Media Retention & Leaving Soon Policy
- Unwatched items staged in Maintainerr Leaving Soon grace periods are kept in the library solely by **active playback**.
- **No manual administrator exemptions:** Users must simply start streaming/watching the title to reset retention. Do not instruct users to open tickets asking for exemptions.

---

## Architecture & REST Engine

Portalarr communicates with Discord using native HTTPS fetch queries without heavy gateway dependencies:

- **Endpoint Client:** `discordFetch<T>(endpoint, options, botToken)` in [`src/lib/discord/discord-bot.ts`](file:///C:/Users/Dom/Documents/GitHub/portalarr/src/lib/discord/discord-bot.ts).
- **Rate Limit Resilience:** Automatically respects Discord HTTP 429 rate limits using exponential backoff (`retry_after` + 150ms buffer, up to 5 attempts).
- **Credentials Storage:** Bot token is encrypted using AES-256-GCM in the `SystemSetting` table under key `DISCORD_BOT_CONFIG`.
- **In-Place Embed Updating:** Pinned embeds are updated in-place via `PATCH /channels/{channelId}/messages/{messageId}` to prevent duplicate message spamming during sync operations.

## Embed Formatting Standards

All Discord embeds generated via `generateDiscordEmbed(key, customData)` in [`src/lib/discord/discord-bot.ts`](file:///C:/Users/Dom/Documents/GitHub/portalarr/src/lib/discord/discord-bot.ts) must adhere to these canonical formats:

### 1. Plex Device Setup Guide (`plex_guides`)
```json
{
  "title": "📱 Plex Device Setup: Enable Direct Play in 30 Seconds",
  "description": "Plex default settings often limit video quality to 720p 2 Mbps over the internet. Follow these steps on your device once to ensure Crystal Clear 4K/1080p Original Quality without server buffering.",
  "color": 16096779,
  "fields": [
    {

---

## Web Account Linking & Verification Workflows

### 1. Member Self-Service Linking (`/settings/profile`)
1. User navigates to **Account Settings $\rightarrow$ Profile $\rightarrow$ Discord Community & Role Sync**.
2. If not yet in the Discord server, user clicks **"Join Discord Community"** (`https://discord.gg/KNvUSmPtD3`).
3. User enters their Discord handle or username (e.g. `username` or `username#1234`).
4. System invokes `linkMyDiscordAccountAction(query)` in [`src/app/discord-actions.ts`](file:///C:/Users/Dom/Documents/GitHub/portalarr/src/app/discord-actions.ts).
5. The bot queries the guild member list via `GET /guilds/{guildId}/members/search?query=...`, resolves the user's Discord ID, saves `discordId`, `discordUsername`, and `discordAvatar` to the `User` record, and immediately grants the `⭐ Member` role in Discord.

### 2. Administrator Manual Linking (`/settings/access`)
1. In the User Management list, administrator clicks **Manage** on any user card to open `subModalUser`.
2. Under **Discord Account Binding**, admin enters the member's Discord handle and clicks **"Link Discord Account"**.
3. System invokes `adminLinkUserByHandleAction(userId, query)`.
4. The bot matches the Discord member, updates the database, provisions the proper role, and displays the user's avatar and snowflake ID.

## User Activity & Login Tracking (`lastLogin`)

- **Database Column:** `User.lastLogin DateTime?` in SQLite schema.
- **Tracking Mechanism:** Recorded automatically in `createSession()` in [`src/app/auth-actions.ts`](file:///C:/Users/Dom/Documents/GitHub/portalarr/src/app/auth-actions.ts) whenever a user logs in with password credentials, signs in via Plex SSO, or switches household sub-profiles.
- **Cookie Lifetime:** Sessions use 30-day persistent JWT cookies (`THIRTY_DAYS_SEC = 2592000`). If a user keeps a browser open without re-authenticating, `lastLogin` preserves their actual last authentication timestamp.
- **UI Exposure:**
  - **User Card:** Prominently displays `Joined: MMM d, yyyy • Last Login: MMM d, yyyy` (or `Never` if not yet logged in).
  - **User Modal (`subModalUser`):** Shows exact timestamp `Last Login: MMM d, yyyy h:mm a` alongside status and cadence info.
