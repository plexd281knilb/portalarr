## 🎬 2. My Plex Hub, Stream Diagnostics & Speed Tests

Your personalized **My Plex Hub** dashboard gives you real-time insight into your active streams, server connections, watch statistics, and playback health.

### 🔴 Real-Time Active Stream Monitoring
- **Live Playback Cards:** View everything currently streaming on your account across Smart TVs, Apple TVs, streaming sticks, web browsers, and phones.
- **Playback Telemetry:** See video resolution (4K UHD, 1080p, 720p), video/audio codecs (HEVC, H.264, EAC3, TrueHD Atmos), playback progress, direct stream bitrate, and hardware NVENC acceleration.
- **Direct Play vs. Transcode Indicators:**
  - 🟢 **Direct Play / Direct Stream:** The media is streaming at original pristine quality without taxing server CPU/GPU.
  - 🟡 **Transcoding (Video/Audio/Subtitles):** The server is converting the file on-the-fly to match your player's capabilities or bandwidth limit.

### 🩺 Transcode Doctor
If a stream is transcoding, click **Transcode Doctor** on the playback card:
- **Instant Root-Cause Analysis:** Identifies why transcoding is occurring (e.g. incompatible audio codec like TrueHD 7.1/DTS, burning PGS/VOBSUB image subtitles, client maximum bitrate cap, or remote quality limit).
- **Device-Specific Fixes:** Provides tailored instructions to adjust your Plex client settings to achieve Direct Play.

### ⏹️ Terminating Stuck Playback Sessions (`Stop Stream`)
If a TV app crashed, lost Wi-Fi, or left a "ghost session" running in the background holding server bandwidth:
1. Click the **Stop Stream** (`⏹️`) button on the active playback card.
2. Confirm the prompt to safely terminate the stuck session.
3. *Security Note:* Users are strictly authorized to terminate only their own playback sessions; administrators can manage all active server streams. You can restart playback on your device anytime!

### 🌐 Connected Plex Servers Modal
Click the **Connected Servers** badge in the hub header to view:
- All healthy Plex Media Server instances linked to your ecosystem (e.g. Main Plex Server, 4K UHD Server).
- Server names, active versions, local/public IP addresses, and secure HTTPS connection statuses.

### ⏱️ Personalized Watch Time Analytics
- **Formatted Days & Hours:** Displays your total streaming duration formatted into clean days and hours (e.g. `33 days 4 hrs` rather than confusing raw hour counts).
- **Milestone Counts:** Tracks your total Movies Finished and TV Episodes Watched, synchronized automatically from your watch history.

### ⚡ In-Browser Server Speed Test
Diagnose buffering or stuttering directly from your current viewing device:
1. Click the **Speed Test** (`⚡`) button in My Plex Hub.
2. Click **Start Test** to measure real-time download bandwidth and latency directly between your browser/device and the media server.
3. Use the measured speed to select the ideal streaming quality preset on your player.

## 🤖 3. Plex & Server Master AI Support Assistant

Need instant help troubleshooting a playback error on your TV or streaming device? Use the built-in **Plex & Server Master AI Assistant**!

### Key Capabilities & How to Ask:
1. **Live Playback Storage & File Health Probing:**
   - Ask the bot to test any specific movie or episode before you start watching:
     - *"Test to make sure The Sandlot runs on the main Plex server"*
     - *"Can you check if Gladiator is ready to play?"*
     - *"Is Dune available with English audio?"*
   - The AI identifies the target server, locates the title in the Plex database, and executes an **active byte-range disk read test** (`Range: bytes=0-65535`) directly against physical media storage.
   - It reports physical readability, disk latency in milliseconds (e.g. `✅ Streamed 64 KB from storage in 18ms`), container format, English audio streams, and subtitle availability.
2. **Device Buffering & Playback Diagnostics:**
   - Type your question or paste the exact error message (e.g. *"not enough bandwidth for any playback of this item. can not convert to below minimum bandwidth"* or *"why is my Roku buffering on 4K?"*).
   - The AI analyzes your active stream telemetry, client player profile, and known platform bugs to provide step-by-step resolution steps tailored to your TV model.
3. **Automated Audio Language Replacement:**
   - If a movie or episode is missing English audio (e.g. Spanish-only release), tell the bot: *"The Sandlot only has Spanish audio"*.
   - The AI inspects the media streams, verifies the absence of English audio, queries connected indexers (Radarr/Sonarr) for an English replacement release, and automatically grabs a verified candidate.
4. **1-Click Ticket Escalation:**
   - If an issue requires administrator intervention, click **Open Ticket With This Diagnosis** to submit a support ticket pre-populated with the AI's diagnostic snapshot!
